{"name":"gettc","tagline":"TopCoder offline arena supporting multiple languages ","body":"Download a [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com/tc) problem, parse the examples and\r\nsystem tests, then finally generate a naive solution for some the following\r\nlanguages:\r\n\r\n- C++\r\n- Haskell\r\n- Java\r\n- Python 3\r\n- Go\r\n\r\nAnd support for more languages is just around the corner.\r\n\r\nYou write the function definition and the generated solution will take care of\r\nrunning it against the downloaded input and output files.\r\n\r\nTopCoder is a heaven for programmers. Solving algorithmic problems is a great\r\nway to embrace the passion for programming. There are problems for all levels. \r\nA strong academic background is not required to enjoy it. If you like Project\r\nEuler, you will probably love TopCoder. \r\n\r\nHowever, the TopCoder online arena is quite inconvenient and supports only a \r\nfew languages. Gettc's goal is to make the practice of solving algorithmic\r\nproblems convenient and fun, and in your desired language.\r\n\r\n# At a glance\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] gem install gettc\r\n    $ gettc 11127\r\n\r\nNote that 11127 is the ID that TopCoder gives to the problem named `DigitHoles`. You\r\ncan find the ID for any problem if you look at the URL for \r\n[that problem's statement](http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=11127) \r\n(you need to have a TopCoder account). Output:\r\n\r\n    You have given ID = 11127\r\n    Downloading problem to raw HTML ... Done\r\n    Parsing problem from raw HTML ... Done\r\n    Generating problem diectory for DigitHoles ... Done\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n\r\n    $ cd DigitHoles/solve/cpp\r\n    $ make demo\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    Check 0 ... 0m0.328s\r\n    Failed\r\n        Input: <42>\r\n        Expected: <1>\r\n        Received: <0>\r\n    Check 1 ... 0m0.015s\r\n    Failed\r\n        Input: <669>\r\n        Expected: <3>\r\n        Received: <0>\r\n    Check 2 ... 0m0.016s\r\n    Failed\r\n        Input: <688>\r\n        Expected: <5>\r\n        Received: <0>\r\n    Check 3 ... 0m0.015s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 4 ... 0m0.016s\r\n    Failed\r\n        Input: <456>\r\n        Expected: <2>\r\n        Received: <0>\r\n    Check 5 ... 0m0.016s\r\n    Failed\r\n        Input: <789>\r\n        Expected: <3>\r\n        Received: <0>\r\n    6 cases checked, 5 failed, 0 errored\r\n    Failed cases: 0 1 2 4 5\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the generated solution actually managed to solve 1 test case. \r\nGettc is pretty smart after all. Anyway, you still need to do the hard work.\r\nOpen the file `DigitHoles.cpp` in your favourite editor and enter the following\r\ncontent:\r\n\r\n    int numHoles(int number) {\r\n        static int holes[] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1};\r\n        int ret = 0;\r\n        while (number > 0) {\r\n            ret += holes[number % 10];\r\n            number /= 10;\r\n        }\r\n        return ret;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then try again:\r\n\r\n    $ make demo\r\n\r\nYou should see:\r\n\r\n    Check 0 ... 0m0.141s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 1 ... 0m0.015s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 2 ... 0m0.016s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 3 ... 0m0.015s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 4 ... 0m0.016s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 5 ... 0m0.015s\r\n    Passed\r\n    6 cases checked, 0 failed, 0 errored\r\n\r\nGood. We have passed all the example tests. Why not challenge the system tests\r\nwhile we are it?\r\n\r\n    $ make sys\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    131 cases checked, 0 failed, 0 errored\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have solved a TopCoder problem like a boss!\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nThe following packages are hard dependencies:\r\n\r\n- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/): The\r\n[Ruby installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/) is recommend for Windows users. \r\n- [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download): Many Ruby installations\r\nalready bundle RubyGems.\r\n- The standard GCC toolset: Most Unix systems have it bundled. Windows users\r\nmay use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) or Cygwin.\r\n\r\nWith those in place, we are aready to go:\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] gem install gettc\r\n\r\nOnce that is done, you should be able to run gettc on the command line. After\r\na solution directory is generated, the standard procedure is:\r\n\r\n    $ cd ProblemName/solve/your_language\r\n    $ make\r\n\r\nNow there are a couple things you need to get depending on your desired language.\r\n\r\n- For C++: You are already ready to solve problems [using C++](https://github.com/seri/gettc/blob/master/plugins/cpp/README.md).\r\n- For Haskell: [Come here](https://github.com/seri/gettc/blob/master/plugins/haskell/README.md)\r\n- For Java: [Come here](https://github.com/seri/gettc/blob/master/plugins/java/README.md)\r\n- For Python: [Come here](https://github.com/seri/gettc/blob/master/plugins/python/README.md)\r\n- For Go: [Come here](https://github.com/seri/gettc/blob/master/plugins/go/README.md)\r\n\r\n# Tips\r\n\r\n- Provide your own username/password in `~/.gettc/config.yml` if download fails.\r\n- Use `make sysv` to display failed cases when challenging the system tests.\r\n- You may `rm -rf build` after you're done solving to save some disk space.\r\n- You can play with the contents of the directory `~/.gettc` to, say, remove things\r\nyou don't want to be generated. If you mess up, you can safely delete the\r\nwhole directory `~/.gettc`. The next time gettc runs, it will notice that \r\nthere is no `~/.gettc` and regenerate that.\r\n- You can bring the solutions generated by gettc to another computer to run.\r\nSuch system doesn't need to have gettc, or even ruby, but it will need the \r\nstandard gcc toolchain, and of course the compiler for your desired language\r\n(if it isn't C++). You will also need to copy `~/.gettc` to that system.\r\n\r\n> This document is for new users.
