You can find the ID for any problem if you look at the URL for [that problem's statement](http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=11127) (you need to have a TopCoder account).

That sucks. Now edit the file `DigitHoles.cpp` with the following content:\r\n\r\n    int numHoles(int number) {\r\n        static int holes[] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1};\r\n        int ret = 0;\r\n        while (number > 0) {\r\n            ret += holes[number % 10];\r\n            number /= 10;\r\n        }\r\n        return ret;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then try again:\r\n\r\n    $ make demo\r\n\r\nYou should see:\r\n\r\n    Check 0 ... 0m0.141s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 1 ... 0m0.015s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 2 ... 0m0.016s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 3 ... 0m0.015s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 4 ... 0m0.016s\r\n    Passed\r\n    Check 5 ... 0m0.015s\r\n    Passed\r\n    6 cases checked, 0 failed, 0 errored\r\n\r\nGood. We have passed all the example tests. Why not challenge the system tests while we are it?\r\n\r\n    $ make sys\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    131 cases checked, 0 failed, 0 errored\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have solved a TopCoder problem like a boss!\r\n\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nDownload a [TopCoder](http://topcoder.com/tc) problem, parse the examples and system tests, then finally generate a basic template for C++, Haskell, and Java. You write the function definition and the generated template will take care of running it against input and output files.\r\n\r\nTopCoder is a heaven for programmers. Solving algorithmic problems is a great way to embrace the passion for programming. There are problems for all levels. A strong academic background is not required to enjoy it. If you like Project Euler, you will probably love TopCoder.\r\n\r\nHowever, you normally have to paste the solution into TopCoder's online arena where it will be checked for correctness. Even then the online arena only supports C++, Java, and C#.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nThe following packages are hard dependencies:\r\n\r\n- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/): The [Ruby installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/) is recommend for Windows users. \r\n- [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download): Many Ruby installations already bundle RubyGems.\r\n- The standard GCC toolset: Most Unix systems have it bundled. Windows users may use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org).\r\n\r\nWith those in place, we are aready to go:\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] gem install gettc\r\n\r\nOnce that is done, you should be able to run gettc on the command line. Now there are a couple things you need to get depending on which language you plan to use to solve problems.\r\n\r\n## For C++\r\n\r\nYou are already ready to solve problems using C++. If you want to use `make test`, you just need to get [Boost](http://www.boost.org/).\r\n\r\n## For Haskell\r\n\r\nBesides GHC, [Cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html) is required. But it could have been bundled by your Haskell installer. Now:\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] cabal update\r\n    $ [sudo] cabal install parsec\r\n\r\nHUnit is required if you wish to apply TDD:\r\n\r\n    $ [sudo] cabal install HUnit\r\n\r\nIf you don't write tests, there is no need to install HUnit.\r\n\r\n## For Java\r\n\r\nBesides JDK, [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) is required. This should come as no surprise to most Java programmers.\r\n\r\nIn Java, you use *ant* instead of *make*. So:\r\n\r\n    $ ant demo\r\n\r\nWill run against the examples. And:\r\n\r\n    $ ant sys\r\n\r\nWill run against the system tests.\r\n\r\n[JUnit](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads) is required if you wish to run unit tests. Don't use the beta versions. Download one of the stable jar archives and put the jar into Ant's lib dir. \r\n\r\n## Other languages\r\n\r\nAt the moment, gettc supports C++, Haskell and Java out of the box. Other languages are provided via plugins.\r\n\r\n# Tips\r\n\r\n- Provide your own username/password in `~/.gettc/config.yml` if download fails.\r\n- Use `make sysv` (or `ant sysv` for Java) to display failed cases when challenging the system tests.\r\n- You may `rm -rf build` after you're done solving to save some disk space.\r\n- You can play with the contents of the directory `~/.gettc` to, say, remove things you don't want to be generated. If you mess up, you can safely delete the whole directory `~/.gettc`. \r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n## Ambiguous function names\r\n\r\nSometimes the solution method has the same name with a standard library function, such as *filter*. In this case, you'll have to manually change the function name to something else in the runner and solution files.\r\n\r\n## String parsing error\r\n\r\nTopCoder allows a string to be like \"This is\" one string\", while gettc gets confused with the quote character in between. If your solution fails only under this situation, it's probably correct.\r\n","google":"UA-42226633-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
